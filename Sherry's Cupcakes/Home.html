        <p float="left" width="60%">Sherry's Bakery was founded in 2015 by word of mouth alone. I used to bake cupcakes
            for friends and family on special occasions. It wasn't until I started to get requests from strangers who
            happened to try one that I realized I might be able to bake as a professional. The first times that I baked
            for someone who wasn't family sure was stressfull but always had a great reaction. From there my cupcakes
            took off. From there I expanded on perfecting more than just my cupcakes. Today we have a bakery where all
            of our staples can be enjoyed, as well as seasonal specials. Feel free to come join our family anytime! Once
            you have one we are sure that you will be back!</p>
